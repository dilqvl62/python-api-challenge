# python-api-challenge
Using Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question:  What is the weather like as we approach the equator

## Add a .gitignore File
For this assignment, you will need to add a .gitignore file to your repo.
Before adding your files to GitHub, add api_keys.py to the .gitignore file by following these steps:
   1. Open your python-api-challenge GitHub folder in VS Code.
   2. Open the .gitignore file and type the following code on the first line:

# Objectives 
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.
## Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the [citipy Python library](https://pypi.org/project/citipy/), [the OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api),  to create a representative model of weather across cities.

* Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
   To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated using the following code .

   Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

            * Latitude vs. Temperature 
            * Latitude vs. Humidity
            * Latitude vs. Cloudiness
            * Latitude vs. Wind Speed
